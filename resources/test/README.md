This folder contains files which are used to test the program.


## Naming Conventions
Files in this directory follow a specific naming convention based on the type of the their contents.
### Sine Wave Files
Sine wave files should follow the following naming convention:

`sine_<frequency>Hz_<samples>samples_[f|s|u]<bit depth>bit_<sample rate>Hz_<'mono'|'stereo'>.wav`

For example:

`sine_440Hz_22050samples_s16bit_44100Hz_stereo.wav`

`sine_220Hz_44100samples_u32bit_44100Hz_mono.wav`

## Notes
The sine wave test files have been generated using Audacity.

The audio files featuring instruments are generated using Musescore 3.
